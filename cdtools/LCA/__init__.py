# cdtools -- a python library for cascading community detection on networks

# cdtools/LCA/__init__.py -- Init script of the LCA submodule.

# Notes on LCA:
#   The Clique Percolation Algorithm was introduced by Y.Y. Ahn et al. in
#
#       "Link communities reveal multiscale complexity in networks"
#        Nature 466, 761â€“764 (2010)
#
#   We use a modified version of the official c++ implementation which is
#   available under a free GNU license. It is somewhat slower and bulkier than
#   the official version, but it has the crucial advantage of being able to
#   handle arbitrary edge lists (non-contiguous integers)
#
#   Bugs and other inquiries regarding this algorithm can be sent to me OR
#   the original authors.
